# UBC Study Sphere

UBC Study Sphere is a web application designed to help UBC students quickly find and book study rooms. By aggregating room availability data from multiple UBC libraries through web scraping, the platform presents up-to-date study room information and provides direct booking links—all in one easy-to-use interface.

- **Scraping data** from UBC library booking systems (e.g., LibCal) using Playwright.
- **Providing a responsive front end** built with React (via Vite) where users can choose their desired timeframe and building.
- **Displaying room details** along with representative building images and direct booking links.

## Features
