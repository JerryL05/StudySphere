# UBC Study Sphere

UBC Study Sphere is a web application designed to help UBC students quickly find and book study rooms. By aggregating room availability data from multiple UBC libraries through web scraping, the platform presents up-to-date study room information and provides direct booking linksâ€”all in one easy-to-use interface.

## Overview

Many UBC students struggle to locate available study spaces during peak times. UBC Study Sphere solves this problem by:
- **Scraping data** from UBC library booking systems (e.g., LibCal) using Playwright.
- **Providing a responsive front end** built with React (via Vite) where users can choose their desired timeframe and building.
- **Displaying room details** along with representative building images and direct booking links.

## Features

- **Real-Time Availability:** Aggregates study room availability from multiple libraries.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Select start and end times with intuitive inline date/time pickers.
- **Building Filter:** Choose a specific building or view all available study rooms.
- **Direct Booking Links:** Click on a room to be redirected to the booking page.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for desktops and mobile devices.
